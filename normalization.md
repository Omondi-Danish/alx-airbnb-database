# ðŸ§  Database Normalization to Third Normal Form (3NF)

This document outlines the normalization process applied to the Airbnb-style booking system database. The goal is to eliminate redundancy, ensure data integrity, and optimize relational structure by transforming the schema into Third Normal Form (3NF).

## âœ… Step 1: First Normal Form (1NF)

**Definition:**  
A table is in 1NF if:
- All attributes contain atomic (indivisible) values
- Each record is unique

**Applied to Our Schema:**  
- All fields (e.g., name, email, location) are atomic  
- No repeating groups or arrays  
- Each entity has a unique primary key (e.g., `user_id`, `property_id`)

âœ… Our schema satisfies 1NF.

---

## âœ… Step 2: Second Normal Form (2NF)

**Definition:**  
A table is in 2NF if:
- It is in 1NF
- All non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the entire primary key (no partial dependencies)

**Applied to Our Schema:**  
- All tables have single-column primary keys (e.g., `booking_id`, `payment_id`)  
- No composite keys, so no partial dependencies exist  
- Attributes like `start_date`, `end_date`, and `status` depend entirely on `booking_id`

âœ… Our schema satisfies 2NF.

---

## âœ… Step 3: Third Normal Form (3NF)

**Definition:**  
A table is in 3NF if:
- It is in 2NF
- There are no transitive dependencies (non-key attributes should not depend on other non-key attributes)

**Reviewing Our Schema for 3NF Violations:**

### Example 1: Property Table  
- `host_id` is a foreign key referencing `User`  
- All other attributes (title, description, location) depend directly on `property_id`  
âœ… No transitive dependency

### Example 2: Booking Table  
- `user_id` and `property_id` are foreign keys  
- Attributes like `start_date`, `end_date`, and `status` depend directly on `booking_id`  
âœ… No transitive dependency

### Example 3: Payment Table  
- `booking_id` is a foreign key  
- `amount`, `method`, and `status` depend directly on `payment_id`  
âœ… No transitive dependency

### Example 4: Review Table  
- `user_id` and `property_id` are foreign keys  
- `rating`, `comment`, and `review_date` depend directly on `review_id`  
âœ… No transitive dependency

## ðŸ§© Summary of Adjustments

No major redesign was required, but the following principles were reinforced:
- Ensured all foreign keys point to primary keys in parent tables
- Avoided storing derived data (e.g., total payments or average ratings) directly in tables
- Separated many-to-many relationships using join tables (e.g., `PropertyAmenity`)

---

## âœ… Final Result

All tables in the Airbnb database schema are now in **Third Normal Form (3NF)**:
- No repeating groups (1NF)
- No partial dependencies (2NF)
- No transitive dependencies (3NF)

This structure supports scalability, efficient querying, and clean data relationships.
